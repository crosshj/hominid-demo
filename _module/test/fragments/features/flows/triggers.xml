          Triggers are different ways of running flows.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h4" whiteSpace="pre-wrap" sx:my='1'>
          Previously we only supported running flows based on user events, such as clicking a button.

          Flows give the builder the ability to run a flow right after the page loads or before the page closes.

          It is mostly used to fetch required data before loading a page or to save progress before leaving it.

        <Alert>
          1. Please notice the "Navigate" with "flowArgs.nextRoutePath" as the route.

          This is REQUIRED for all flows that are triggered with "onClose".
          
          Why? In order to run the flow, we must stop the default behavior of leaving the page,
          therefore giving the Flow the responsibility of doing that. 

          We could do this automtically, yes, but there are a lot of abstractions in place here and
          we figured it was better for the builder to do it manually since it makes it more predictable.
